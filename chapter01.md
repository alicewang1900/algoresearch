# Chapter 01: Input and Simulation

### Overview

This chapter introduces basic input/output methods and simulation techniques used to model problems in programming contests. These techniques are often the first step toward solving computational problems that do not require deep algorithms but depend on careful implementation and attention to detail.

### Core Techniques

1. **Basic I/O**: Using `cin`/`cout` in C++ or `input()`/`print()` in Python
2. **String Parsing**: Using `.split()`, string indexing, and conversions like `int()` or `str()`
3. **Array Manipulation**: Initialization, iteration, and element modification
4. **Simulation**: Implementing step-by-step processes based on problem descriptions

### Sample Problems

#### 1. Count the Number of Vowels

**Problem**: Given a string, count how many vowels it contains.

#### 2. Simulate a Robot on a Grid

**Problem**: Given a string of commands (`L`, `R`, `U`, `D`), compute the final coordinates of a robot starting from (0, 0).

#### 3. Simulate Traffic Light Timer

**Problem**: Given red, green, and yellow durations and a list of traffic light states at intersections, simulate when a car can safely pass.

### Summary

- Input/output is the foundation of all competitive programming problems.
- Many implementation-heavy problems require accurate simulation.
- Focus on edge cases, input size, and clean, logical process handling.
